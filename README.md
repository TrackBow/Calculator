# Simple Qt Calculator

A basic calculator application built with C++ and the Qt framework. This project was created as an exercise to understand the fundamentals of creating a GUI application, handling user input, and managing layouts in Qt.

### ‚ú® What this Project Demonstrates

*   **GUI Layout Management:** The user interface is built programmatically using `QGridLayout` and `QHBoxLayout` to arrange widgets in a responsive grid.
*   **Widget Usage:** Makes use of standard Qt widgets like `QPushButton` for the number pad and `QSpinBox` for input and display.
*   **Event Handling with Signals & Slots:** The core logic is driven by Qt's powerful signals and slots mechanism.
*   **Modern C++ Syntax:** Uses C++11 lambda functions for connecting signals to slots, resulting in cleaner and more concise code.
*   **Basic State Management:** Implements simple logic to handle a two-term calculation (addition and multiplication) by storing the first term and the selected operation.
